ðŸ“Œ Project: Decision Tree Model on Teen Phone Addiction Dataset

This project explores teen phone addiction patterns using a Decision Tree Algorithm in Python. The dataset (teen_phone_addiction_dataset.csv) contains survey-based information about teenagers' mobile phone usage, habits, and related factors.

ðŸ”¹ Whatâ€™s inside the repo:

Decision_Tree_algo.ipynb â†’ Jupyter Notebook with data cleaning, EDA, model training, and evaluation using a Decision Tree Classifier.

model.pkl â†’ Pre-trained Decision Tree model saved with pickle for easy deployment or reuse.

teen_phone_addiction_dataset.csv â†’ Raw dataset used for training and analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and correlations.

Built and trained a Decision Tree Classifier to predict addiction levels.

Saved the model for further use in deployment (web apps, APIs, or Streamlit dashboards).

ðŸš€ How to Use:

Open the notebook and run the cells step by step.

Load the dataset and follow the preprocessing steps.

Use the trained model (model.pkl) for predictions.

This repo is a simple but complete example of applying Machine Learning for behavioral analysis. Perfect for beginners learning Decision Trees, model saving/loading, and real-world dataset handling.
